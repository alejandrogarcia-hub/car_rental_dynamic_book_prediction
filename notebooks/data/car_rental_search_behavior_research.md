- 2nd character: Chassis type and doors
- 3rd character: Transmission type
- 4th character: Fuel/AC specifications

### Customer Selection Factors

Primary considerations:

1. Number of passengers
2. Luggage capacity
3. Trip duration
4. Budget constraints
5. Fuel economy

## 4. Seasonal and Pricing Patterns

### Seasonal Variations

- **Pricing**: Varies by vehicle size, seasonality, length of rental, availability, and location
- **Vehicle availability**: Certain types have strong seasonal patterns
  - Example: Convertibles not available in northern locations during winter

### Distribution Channels

- **Offline channels**: Growing from 61% (2017) to projected 72% (2027)
- **Online channels**: Expected to generate 73% of revenue by 2028

## 5. Market Statistics and Projections

### User Base Growth

- 2019: 450.5 million users globally
- 2020: 284.59 million (COVID-19 impact)
- 2023: 547.02 million
- 2028 projection: 644.4 million

### User Penetration

- 2023: 6.7% global penetration
- 2027 projection: 7.8%

### Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

- Asia: $141.40
- Europe: $279.60
- United States: $630
- Global average: $181.00

## 6. Key Behavioral Insights for Modeling

### Search Behavior Patterns

1. **Search inputs commonly tracked**:
   - Locations (pickup/dropoff)
   - Vehicle types
   - Dates
   - Price ranges

2. **Browsing patterns**:
   - Time spent on specific car models
   - Filter usage patterns
   - Comparison shopping behavior

3. **Booking history indicators**:
   - Frequencies
   - Trip purposes
   - Vehicle preferences

### Operational Implications

- Peak rental/return periods at each station are predictable
- Vehicle dispatch can be optimized using demand patterns
- User segmentation enables personalized service offerings

## Data Sources and Limitations

### Primary Sources

- Academic papers from Journal of Advanced Transportation
- Market research from Statista, Grand View Research, Mordor Intelligence
- Industry reports from Auto Rental News, Enterprise Apps Today
- Consumer behavior studies from Zubie, NerdWallet

### Limitations

- Specific search frequency per user per year not explicitly documented
- Most data focuses on transactions rather than search behavior
- Regional variations may not be fully captured
- COVID-19 significantly impacted 2020-2021 patterns

## Recommendations for Synthetic Data Generation

Based on this research, the synthetic data generator should incorporate:

1. **User frequency distribution**: Poisson or negative binomial distribution with mean ~2 rentals/year
2. **Location popularity**: Weight by regional market share percentages
3. **Car class distribution**: Match the 32% economy, decreasing for higher classes
4. **Temporal patterns**: Include daily peaks and weekly patterns
5. **Conversion rates**: Apply 2.5% search-to-booking conversion
6. **Demographics**: Reflect gender and user type distributions
7. **Seasonal variations**: Implement location-based vehicle availability constraints

## Future Research Needs

1. Detailed search frequency distributions per user segment
2. Cross-regional price elasticity data
3. Mobile vs desktop conversion rate differences
4. Impact of loyalty programs on search behavior
5. Real-time pricing response patterns
