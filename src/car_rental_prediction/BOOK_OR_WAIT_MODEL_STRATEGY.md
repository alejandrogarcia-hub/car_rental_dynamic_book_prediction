## Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive strategy for implementing machine learning models to solve the "Book or Wait" decision problem in car rental pricing. The goal is to help customers decide whether to book a rental car immediately (if prices are likely to increase) or wait for better pricing (if prices are likely to decrease) within a 7-day window.

### Purpose and Scope

**Purpose**: Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning approaches to predict optimal booking timing for car rental customers, enabling data-driven decisions that could save customers money while optimizing supplier revenue.

**Scope**: Covers research methodology, model selection, implementation details, performance evaluation, and business impact analysis across four different modeling approaches: traditional machine learning, gradient boosting, deep learning, and time series forecasting.

### Key Business Value

Our research identified that this problem mirrors successful implementations in the travel industry:
- **Flight price prediction platforms** show "book now" vs "wait" recommendations
- **Hotel booking platforms** use price trend analysis for timing recommendations
- **Car rental customers** could save 5-15% on average through optimal timing decisions

## Research Methodology

### Industry Analysis

Before implementation, we conducted extensive research on similar use cases in the travel and booking industry:

#### 1. Travel Industry Benchmarks
- **Price Forecasting Services**: Use historical price data and machine learning to predict if prices will rise or fall
- **Flight Price Tracking**: Analyzes price trends and recommends booking timing
- **Hotel Price Alerts**: Monitor prices and suggest optimal booking windows

#### 2. Academic Research
- **Revenue Management Studies**: Research on dynamic pricing in travel industry
- **Consumer Behavior Analysis**: Studies on booking timing preferences and price sensitivity
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Applications of Prophet, LSTM, and other models in price prediction

#### 3. Technical Approach Research
- **Binary Classification**: "Book now" (1) vs "Wait" (0) as primary prediction task
- **Time Series Perspective**: Price forecasting with decision logic
- **Feature Engineering**: Price trends, volatility, seasonality, and competitive factors
- **Evaluation Metrics**: ROC-AUC for model comparison, business impact for practical value

## Problem Definition

### Core Problem Statement

Given current rental car pricing and market conditions, should a customer:
- **Book Now** (1): Current price is likely the best available in next 7 days
- **Wait** (0): Better prices are likely to appear in next 7 days

### Technical Specification

**Input Features**:
- Current rental price and historical price trends
- Supplier information and competitive pricing
- Temporal features (day of week, seasonality, advance booking window)
- Market conditions (availability, demand indicators)

**Output**: Binary classification with probability scores
- `0`: Wait for better prices (price likely to decrease)
- `1`: Book now (price likely to increase or remain stable)

**Prediction Window**: 7 days (industry standard booking window)

**Success Criteria**:
- Model accuracy >85% (better than random guessing)
- ROC-AUC >0.80 (good discrimination between classes)
- Business impact: potential customer savings >5%

### Data Characteristics and Challenges

**Class Imbalance**: Our synthetic data revealed a significant imbalance:
- **Book Now**: 87.6% of decisions (majority class)
- **Wait**: 12.4% of decisions (minority class)

**Rationale**: In car rental markets, prices tend to increase closer to pickup dates due to:
- Inventory constraints (fewer cars available)
- Demand increases (last-minute bookings)
- Revenue management algorithms (dynamic pricing)

**Challenge**: Models can achieve high accuracy by always predicting "Book Now" but fail to capture the valuable "Wait" opportunities.

## Model Selection Strategy

Based on our research, we selected four complementary approaches representing different modeling paradigms:

### 1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
**Purpose**: Establish baseline performance with interpretable model
**Rationale**: Simple, fast, interpretable - industry standard for binary classification
**Expected Performance**: Moderate (ROC-AUC 0.80-0.85)

### 2. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
**Purpose**: Capture complex feature interactions and non-linear patterns
**Rationale**: Excellent performance on tabular data, handles mixed data types well
**Expected Performance**: High (ROC-AUC 0.85-0.92)

### 3. LSTM (Deep Learning)
**Purpose**: Capture sequential price patterns and temporal dependencies
**Rationale**: Superior for time series data with complex patterns
**Expected Performance**: Variable (depends on sequence data availability)

### 4. Prophet (Time Series Forecasting)
**Purpose**: Direct price forecasting with business logic for decisions
**Rationale**: Purpose-built for time series, interpretable forecasts
**Expected Performance**: Moderate to High (depends on data quality)

## Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

### Dataset Overview

Our synthetic dataset provides realistic car rental scenarios:
- **Users**: 10,000 registered users across 5 behavioral segments
- **Searches**: 29,000+ searches with realistic temporal patterns
- **Bookings**: 725 actual bookings (2.5% conversion rate)
- **Price Data**: 50,000+ price observations across 24 locations, 5 suppliers, 4 car classes
- **Time Period**: 365 days of synthetic data with seasonal patterns

### Feature Engineering Strategy

#### 1. Price-Based Features
**Current Price Metrics**:
- `current_price`: Base price for the rental
- `price_change_1d`, `price_change_3d`, `price_change_7d`: Short-term price trends
- `price_volatility_7d`: Price stability indicator
- `price_percentile`: Current price vs historical range
- `price_trend`: Linear regression slope of recent prices

**Competitive Features**:
- `price_vs_competitors`: Relative pricing position
- `is_cheapest`: Boolean indicator of lowest price
- `price_rank`: Percentile rank vs competitors

#### 2. Temporal Features
**Date/Time Components**:
- `day_of_week`: Captures weekly booking patterns
- `month`: Seasonal effects
- `quarter`: Quarterly business cycles
- `is_weekend`: Weekend vs weekday pricing
- `is_peak_season`: High-demand periods (summer, holidays)

**Booking Window**:
- `days_until_pickup`: Advance booking period
- `days_until_rental`: Alternative time measurement

#### 3. Market Features
**Supply/Demand Indicators**:
- `available_cars`: Inventory levels
- `supplier_id`: Brand effects
- `location_id`: Geographic pricing variations
- `car_class`: Vehicle category (economy, compact, SUV, luxury)

#### 4. Prophet-Specific Features
**Forecast-Based Features** (Prophet model only):
- `forecast_trend`: Predicted price direction
- `forecast_volatility`: Expected price variability
- `forecast_uncertainty`: Confidence in predictions
- `price_vs_forecast_mean`: Current price vs forecast average

### Target Variable Creation

**Label Generation Logic**:
```python
# For each observation at time t:
future_prices = prices[t+1:t+8]  # Next 7 days
max_future_price = max(future_prices)
current_price = prices[t]

# Target: 1 = Book Now, 0 = Wait
target = 1 if current_price < max_future_price else 0
```

**Business Logic**: 
- If current price is lower than any price in next 7 days → Book Now (1)
- If current price equals or exceeds all future prices → Wait (0)

### Dataset Splitting Strategy

**Time-Based Split** (not random):
- **Training**: First 80% of time period (maintains temporal order)
- **Testing**: Last 20% of time period (simulates real-world deployment)
- **Rationale**: Prevents data leakage, reflects real-world model deployment

**Why Not Random Split?**
- Random splits can leak future information into training
- Time-based splits better simulate production environment
- More realistic evaluation of model performance

## Model Implementations

### 1. Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)

#### Implementation Details
**Framework**: PyTorch for GPU compatibility
**Architecture**: Single linear layer with sigmoid activation
**Features**: 18 engineered features plus categorical encodings
**Training**: Adam optimizer, BCE loss, 100 epochs

#### Key Design Decisions
**CPU/GPU Compatibility**: 
```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)
```

**Class Imbalance Handling**:
```python
# Weighted loss to handle 87.6% vs 12.4% imbalance
pos_weight = torch.tensor([len(y_train) / (2 * y_train.sum())])
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
```

**Data Preprocessing**:
- StandardScaler for numerical features
- Categorical encoding for suppliers, locations, car classes
- Missing value imputation with zeros
- Infinite value replacement

#### Performance Results
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.9032
- **Training Samples**: 2,192
- **Test Samples**: 548
- **Training Time**: ~30 seconds on CPU

#### Visualizations Generated in Notebook
The baseline model notebook produces several key visualizations that help understand model performance:

1. **Training History Plot**: Shows convergence of training and test loss/accuracy over 50 epochs. The loss plot demonstrates stable convergence around epoch 20, while accuracy remains steady around 90%. Both training and test curves track closely, indicating no overfitting.

2. **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**: A 2x2 matrix showing actual vs predicted classifications. The matrix reveals the model's strength in predicting the majority class ("Book Now") with high accuracy, but shows some weakness in correctly identifying "Wait" opportunities, which is expected given the class imbalance.

3. **Feature Importance Bar Chart**: A horizontal bar chart displaying logistic regression weights for each feature. Price change features (1-day, 3-day, 7-day) show the highest absolute weights, indicating their strong predictive power. Competitive pricing features and temporal variables also show meaningful contributions.

4. **Business Impact Confidence Distribution**: Multiple overlapping histograms showing model confidence scores distributed by prediction outcome (True Positive, False Negative, etc.). This visualization reveals how confident the model is when making different types of predictions, helping identify when the model is most reliable.

#### Key Insights from Generated Visualizations
The baseline model visualizations reveal:

1. **Quick Convergence**: Training loss stabilizes quickly due to simple linear architecture
2. **Class Imbalance Impact**: Confusion matrix shows strong majority class performance but weaker minority class detection
3. **Feature Interpretability**: Price trend features clearly dominate decision making, with competitive position as secondary factor
