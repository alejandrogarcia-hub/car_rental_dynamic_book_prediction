"""
Realistic car rental search data generator with temporal and behavioral patterns.

This module creates synthetic car rental search data that follows real-world patterns
observed in the travel industry. It's designed to help data scientists understand
car rental search behavior and build realistic datasets for model training.

**Key Difference from SessionBasedSearchGenerator:**
While SessionBasedSearchGenerator focuses on detailed user segmentation and session
clustering, this generator emphasizes temporal patterns, user segments, and
statistical distributions. Both approaches are valuable for different use cases.

**Research Foundation:**
- Average user rents 2 cars per year (industry standard)
- 2.5% search-to-booking conversion rate (travel industry benchmark)
- Location popularity follows actual market share distribution
- User segments have distinct search frequency patterns
- Temporal patterns follow real seasonal and weekly trends

**When to Use This Generator:**
- Need emphasis on temporal patterns (seasonal, weekly, hourly)
- Want simpler user segmentation (5 segments vs detailed behavioral analysis)
- Focus on statistical distribution modeling
- Building baseline models before adding session complexity

**Pipeline Position:**
This is an alternative to SessionBasedSearchGenerator for the first step:
1. **This module OR SessionBasedSearchGenerator** → Generate search patterns
2. RealisticBookingGenerator → Convert searches to bookings
3. RealisticPriceGenerator → Add pricing data
4. Analysis → Train prediction models

class RealisticSearchGenerator:
    """
    Generates realistic car rental search data based on real-world distributions.

    This generator creates synthetic search data that closely matches patterns observed
    in real car rental booking platforms. It's particularly strong at modeling:
    - Temporal patterns (seasonal peaks, weekly cycles, hourly patterns)
    - User behavior segments with different search intensities
    - Location popularity based on real market data
    - Statistical distributions that match real user behavior

    **Core Research Findings Implemented:**
    - Average user rents 2 cars per year (basis for search volume calculation)
    - 2.5% overall search-to-booking conversion rate (industry benchmark)
    - Location popularity follows actual US car rental market share
    - 5 distinct user segments with different search frequency patterns
    - Seasonal patterns peak in summer months (June-August)
    - Weekly patterns favor business days and weekends differently
    - Hourly patterns peak during lunch and evening hours

    **User Segments (Simplified Model):**
    1. **Occasional Leisure (40%):** Low-frequency leisure travelers
    2. **Regular Leisure (25%):** More frequent vacation travelers
    3. **Business Occasional (15%):** Some business travel
    4. **Business Frequent (15%):** Regular business travelers
    5. **Super Users (5%):** Very high frequency users

    **Key Statistical Approach:**
    Uses negative binomial distribution to model search counts per user, which
    better captures the high variance in real user behavior compared to Poisson.
    Most users search very little, but some search extensively.

        Generate realistic search data based on extensive travel industry research.

        This is the main orchestration method that combines user segmentation,
        statistical distributions, and temporal patterns to create a realistic
        synthetic dataset of car rental searches.

        **Complete Generation Process:**

        1. **User Segmentation:** Assign users to behavioral segments with different
           search intensities (occasional leisure, business frequent, etc.)

        2. **Search Volume Calculation:** Calculate expected searches per user based on
           the time period and their segment's frequency multiplier

        3. **Statistical Distribution:** Use negative binomial distribution to generate
           realistic variation in searches per user (most search little, some search a lot)

        4. **Temporal Pattern Generation:** Create timestamps following real-world patterns:
           - Seasonal peaks in summer months
           - Weekly patterns favoring business days and weekends
           - Hourly patterns with lunch and evening peaks

        5. **Location Assignment:** Weight locations by real market popularity
           (airports and major cities get more searches)

        6. **Car Class Assignment:** Use real market share data for car type preferences

        **Key Algorithms:**
        - Negative binomial distribution for search counts (captures high variance)
        - Multi-dimensional temporal weighting (month × weekday × hour)
        - Weighted random sampling for locations and car classes

        **Output Quality:**
        The generated data includes realistic patterns that match industry benchmarks:
        - Seasonal vacation peaks
        - Business vs leisure travel patterns
        - Geographic demand concentration
        - User behavior segmentation

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Complete synthetic search dataset with columns:
                - search_id: Sequential unique identifier (1, 2, 3, ...)
                - user_id: User who performed the search (1 to n_users)
                - location_id: Rental location (1-24, weighted by market data)
                - search_ts: Search timestamp (realistic temporal patterns)
                - car_class: Car type (economy/compact/suv/luxury, weighted by market share)
                - user_segment: User behavioral segment for analysis
        """
        # **Step 1: User Segmentation**
        # Assign each user to a behavioral segment (e.g., business traveler, leisure user)
        # Each segment has different search intensities based on real travel patterns
        user_segments, freq_multipliers = self._generate_user_segments()

        # **Step 2: Time Period Adjustment**
        # Scale search volume based on how much of a year our data covers
        # Example: 6 months of data = 0.5 year = 50% of annual search volume
        days_in_period = (self.end_date - self.start_date).days
        period_fraction = days_in_period / 365.0
        base_searches = self.avg_searches_per_user_per_year * period_fraction

        # **Step 3: Apply Segment Multipliers**
        # Adjust base search volume by each user's segment behavior
        # Example: Business frequent (3.0x) vs occasional leisure (0.5x)
        expected_searches = base_searches * freq_multipliers

        # **Step 4: Generate Realistic Search Count Variation**
        # Use negative binomial distribution to model real user behavior patterns
        #
        # **Why Negative Binomial vs Poisson?**
        # Real user data shows high variance (some users search 100x, others 1x)
        # Poisson assumes variance = mean (too restrictive)
        # Negative binomial allows variance > mean (realistic for user behavior)
        #
        # **Mathematical Intuition:**
        # "Keep flipping a biased coin until you get r successes"
        # Lower r = higher variance = more realistic user behavior spread
        r = 2.0  # Shape parameter (lower = more variance in user behavior)
        p = r / (r + expected_searches)  # Probability parameter for each user
        searches_per_user = self.rng.negative_binomial(r, p)

        # **Step 5: Apply Business Logic Constraints**
        # Ensure active users (business travelers, regular users) have at least 1 search
        # This prevents unrealistic cases where frequent travelers generate 0 searches
        active_mask = freq_multipliers > 0.7  # Business and regular users
        searches_per_user[active_mask] = np.maximum(1, searches_per_user[active_mask])

        # **Step 6: Individual Search Record Generation**
        # Create detailed search records for each user based on their search count
        search_records = []
        search_id = 1  # Sequential ID counter

            if n_user_searches == 0:
                continue

            # **Step 7: Generate Realistic Timestamps**
            # Create timestamps that follow seasonal, weekly, and hourly patterns

                max(n_user_searches * 3, 10)  # Minimum 10 to ensure good sampling
            )

            # **Step 8: Fallback Timestamp Generation**
            # If temporal pattern generation didn't produce enough dates, create fallback
            # This ensures every user gets their expected number of searches
